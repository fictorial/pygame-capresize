# Stretchable Capped Images for Pygame

This module creates a Pygame surface from a source surface that has "end caps"
on its corners. The caps remain unscaled in the destination surface and the
other portions are scaled/stretched or tiled.

This was inspired by Android's `NinePatch` and iOS'
`resizableImageWithCapInsets`.
